# Contributing

## Branches
- `main`: production-ready
- `dev`: integration branch
- `feature/*`: individual features

## Flow
1. Create branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-thing`
2. Commit small and often
3. Push: `git push -u origin feature/your-thing`
4. Open PR -> target `dev`
5. Auto-merge to `main` after testing, or open PR `dev -> main`

## Commit style
- `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `chore: ...`, `docs: ...`, `refactor: ...`
