### VERIFY
- [ ] Load the SmartFlow homepage (desktop, reduced motion disabled) and confirm the new circuit backdrop renders animated energy channels with flowing particles and pulses.
- [ ] Enable the "prefers reduced motion" setting in the operating system or browser, reload the page, and verify that the backdrop does not initialize and no background canvas is mounted.

### UNDO
- [ ] Revert the commit titled "feat(static): translate circuit flow visualization" using `git revert <commit-hash>` and redeploy.
