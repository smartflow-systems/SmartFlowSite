Please find a solution for this failing job. Use the logs, job definition, and any referenced files where the failure occurred. Keep your response focused on the solution and include code suggestions when appropriate.

The failing job is a CodeQL code scanning job. The error is:

    CodeQL detected code written in JavaScript/TypeScript and Python, but not any written in GitHub Actions. Confirm that there is some source code for GitHub Actions in the project. For more information, review our troubleshooting guide at https://gh.io/troubleshooting-code

Root Cause:
Your CodeQL analysis workflow is set to scan for "actions" language, but your repository does not contain any GitHub Actions source code. Instead, it contains JavaScript/TypeScript and Python code.

Solution:
You need to update the CodeQL workflow so it scans the actual languages present in your repo (JavaScript, TypeScript, Python), not "actions".
How to Fix

    Edit the CodeQL workflow file.
    Find the workflow at: dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql.

    Locate the languages: section.
    It likely looks like this:
    YAML

languages: ['actions']

Change it to the actual languages:
YAML

    languages: ['javascript', 'python']

    Commit and push the change.
    This will trigger the workflow again and the CodeQL analysis will run on your real codebase.

Example Code Change
YAML

# Before
languages: ['actions']

# After
languages: ['javascript', 'python']

If you also use TypeScript:
YAML

languages: ['javascript', 'typescript', 'python']

Summary:
Update the CodeQL workflow to scan the languages you use (remove 'actions', add 'javascript', 'python', and/or 'typescript'), then rerun the workflow.
